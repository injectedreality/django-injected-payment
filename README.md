Django Injected Project -- Payment
==================================

As part of a growing and, for the most part, independant collection of installable apps for the Django Project. 

Purpose
-------
When attempting to implement a payment provider for a client we did not really find a payment provider backend that fit
customize for the required provider. The one closest to the mark was django-getpaid so you might find some of the same 
patterns in the base components of this app. 

Payment focuses on multiple payment instruments for multiple providers.
